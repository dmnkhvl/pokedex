## Data layer

### **React Router Loaders**

The app uses React Router loaders to fetch Pok√©mon data before the page loads, ensuring an optimal user experience. This avoids unnecessary client-side fetches and improves performance.

### **Client-side Fetching**

- **Load More Pok√©mon**: Fetches additional Pok√©mon details dynamically.
- **Search Functionality**: Uses a prefetched list and a debounced input to quickly find Pok√©mon by name.

It results in:

- ‚ö° **Fast initial load** via pre-fetched data.
- üîç **Instant search results** with optimized client-side fetching.
- üîÑ **Efficient updates** using React Router loaders.

## Styles

I chose Tailwind CSS for its excellent developer experience, ease of prototyping, and seamless adaptability across different screen sizes.

For few component in UI library I chose CVA to handle different variants and sizes, to ensure scalable and maintable components.
